# Simulating Game Player

Problem settings: Bots are easy to detect due to stereotype movements e.g., predefined coordinates (X,Y)

Aim: simulate the movements of game players to make bots move or walk like humans.

Train sequences of moves

Predict next moves

# Models 
LSTM, train sequences of moves

# Data
Scrape behaviors from the gaming forum, "move to loc" scripts
AND use pre-determined bot scripts
